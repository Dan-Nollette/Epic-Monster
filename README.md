# Epic-Monster

This is my (currently in progress) Epicodus Capstone Project.

### Epic Monster is born out of a love for my classmates at Epicodus and my desire to showcase their talents for the world to see. The idea is to create a job site that allows for the set up of both employer and job seeker profiles. My plan is for it to look utilitarian and functional if not particularly flashy (think Craigslist). When complete the site will have the ability to host job seeker profiles that really showcase the talents and passions of the potential hire. I'll be asking classmates for their permission to create profiles for them to seed the project for demo purposes.

### At present I have implemented CRUD and user authentication using bcrypt, but there is still much more to do.
